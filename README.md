# Solutions to Coursera Johns Hopkins Specialization in Data Science course

## The Data Scientist's Toolbox
This is the primary introductory course for the specialization. It 
should be taken first and has no prerequisite courses. Students 
should be computer literate, have programmed in at least one 
computer language and be motivated self learners. 
 
## R Programming
This is the most crucial course for the remainder of the 
specialization. It is softly dependent on The Data Scientist¡¯s 
Toolbox. It should be taken before the remaining courses in the 
series. 
 
## Getting and Cleaning Data
This course has hard dependencies on R Programming and 
The Data Scientist¡¯s Toolbox. 
 
## Exploratory Data Analysis
This course has hard dependencies on R Programming and 
The Data Scientist¡¯s Toolbox. 
 
 
 
## Reproducible Research
This course has hard dependencies on R Programming and 
The Data Scientist¡¯s Toolbox. 
 
 
## Statistical Inference
This course has hard dependencies on R Programming and 
The Data Scientist¡¯s Toolbox. In addition, students will need 
basic (non calculus) mathematics skills.  
 
 
 
## Regression Models
This course has hard dependencies on R Programming, The 
Data Scientist¡¯s Toolbox and Statistical Inference. 
 
 
## Practical Machine Learning
This course has hard dependencies on R Programming, The 
Data Scientist¡¯s Toolbox and Regression Models. It has a soft 
dependency on Exploratory Data Analysis.  
 
## Developing Data Products
This course has hard dependencies on R Programming, The 
Data Scientist¡¯s Toolbox and Reproducible Research. It has a 
soft dependency of Exploratory Data Analysis.
